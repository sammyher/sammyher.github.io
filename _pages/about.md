I am a student in UC San Diego's class of 2026, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I am comfortable coding in several languages, including C/C++, Python, Java, Bash, and Go.

When I'm not in classes, I work as a CSE Tutor for the UC San Diego CSE Department. I've had the opportunity to lead student groups as a Head Tutor and Lead Tutor, helping others learn programming in C and Python. I've also gained research experience as a Research Assistant at the ESB.AI Lab, where I optimized hardware for remote data collection systems and contributed to the data pipeline for training object detection models.

I'm also involved on campus as a member of Nueva Herencia and IEEE, where I participate in workshops and team projects. In the rare moments I'm free, I enjoy fishing, snorkeling, and exploring San Diego!
