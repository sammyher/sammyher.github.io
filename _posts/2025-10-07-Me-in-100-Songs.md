Someone asked me what kind of music I listen to last week, and I struggled to give them a straight answer. My taste has always been a bit all over the place. But the question stuck with me and got me thinking: what songs have truly shaped who I am? So, I decided to compile them. Here are 100 songs, in no particular order, that have made me, me.

1. "Would I Lie To You?" by Charles & Eddie
2. eh ill finish this later
